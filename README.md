# Spotify-Clone
🎵 Spotify Clone 🎵 : A simple Spotify-inspired web music player built using "HTML", "CSS", and "JavaScript". This single-web-page design mimics basic Spotify features like playing songs, navigating through playlists, controlling volume, and auto-playing the next track.
It’s not connected to the actual Spotify API — instead, it plays local audio files from the project’s `songs/` folder.

## Features
- ▶️ Play and pause songs from a playlist
- ⏭️ Next and previous track navigation
- 🎚️ Seek through a song using the progress bar
- 📊 Volume control (with mute/unmute)
- 🖼 Playlist view with song titles and cover images
- 🔄 Auto-play next song when the current one ends
